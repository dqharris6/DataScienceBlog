<h2>(100 points) Blogging is Life</h2>

<p>Your goal is to write a compelling blog post for a general audience about your data visualization. What question are you asking? Why is it important? What did you discover? What methods did you use and why? And so forth. <b>We expect a post of around 500-800 words.</b>

</p><p>This should not just be a replay of your viz discussion from Homework 3; the goal of that discussion was to argue to me for you design choices and the quality of your viz. In this case, you should assume that your audience is someone who may not even know what the NDSUH is at all. So you should target a general interest audience. And you should focus on <b>communicating</b> the key takeaways and findings you have made.

</p><p>You may re-use your viz directly from Homework 3, or you may choose to update it if you like. 

</p><p>Your post itself should be written in markdown or in html. There are great free markdown editors like <a href="https://stackedit.io/">stackedit</a>. Free feel to use whatever you like; but make it simple enough that we can easily drop into our own blogging system.

</p><p>There are great tips on writing <a href="https://cgi.duke.edu/web/sciwriting/index.php?action=lesson1">here</a>.
