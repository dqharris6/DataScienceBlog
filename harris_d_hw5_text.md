### What's More Important: Drinking or Graduating?

It's no question that harmful and underage college drinking poses significant public health problems, and takes an enormous toll on the intellectual and social lives of students on campuses across the United States.

Students either have seasoned drinking habits in place upon entering college, or are eager to experiment with what they've been sheltered from in the first 18 years of their lives. 



The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a primary source of statistical information on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 or older. The survey also collects data on mental disorders, co-occurring substance use and mental disorders, and treatment for substance use and mental health problems.
