## Drinking vs. Graduating: A College Student's Guide to Staying In on Friday Night

It's no question that underage college drinking poses significant public health problems, and takes an enormous toll on the intellectual and social lives of students on campuses across the United States. Drinking has become ritual for America's college students, as many see it as an integral part of their higher education. Students either have seasoned drinking habits in place upon entering college, or are eager to experiment with what they've been sheltered from in their first 18 years. Our visualization compares per capita alcohol consumption among college-age students per state to average 4-year college graduation rates per state, to answer the fundamental question: “How do Alcohol Use and College Graduation Rates correlate by State?”.

### Not All US States are Drunk...

First, we took a look at which states report drinking the most. Rather than factoring in all states, we focused on Beer Marketer’s Insights’ “States That Drink the Most Beer” to narrow our scope to Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. This decision eliminates factors such as religous affiliations (no suprise that Utah is one of the states with the lowest alcohol consumptions) and shipping costs of beer (taking out Hawaii and Alaska), and leaves us to analyze the states that we know are drinking the most. We note that New Hampshire (home of Dartmouth) is the only state containing an Ivy League school on our list, which consistently ranks last of these overall academic performance.

### ... But All College Students Are

So, how do we know that this 20% of America is full of alcoholics? We turn to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which collects and aggregates drug, alcohol, tobacco and mental health information year after year. From their 2015 dataset, we pulled the table "Alcohol Use in the Past Month, by Age Group and State (Based on 2013 and 2014 NSDUHs)", which lines out confidence intervals of self-reported drinkers by age group by state. Since we're only intersted in college-age drinkers, we extracted the 18-25 year-olds, and put this over the total population to calculate our state percentages. Of those aforementioned, every single state reports a higher percentage of 18-25 year-olds drinking alcohol than students (that start school) graduating college. *This means that in these 11 states, there are more students dropping out of college than there are practicing temperance.*
